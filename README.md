Technologies: R, Statistical tests, Statistical Analysis, Data Collection and Processing

Testudo, the mascot of the University of Maryland, is a bronze statue of a Chesapeake Bay diamondback turtle, an animal known for its ability to bite off the hands and feet of the unwary, which is placed proudly in the middle of campus, demonstrating the integral role it
plays in University pride and culture. Legend has it that rubbing the nose of Testudo brings good luck to the individual. This tradition has been present since the early 1930’s, from the time Testudo became the mascot and pride of the entire UMD community. We are eager to find the outcome of this long-held tradition in the UMD student community based on data and statistical analysis. We expect to find a varied range of experiences from this practice. We will conduct a hypothesis testing to determine that rubbing the nose of
testudo would shower people with good luck. The results obtained would give the UMD community an insight into this strong held belief which has been practiced for almost 80 years. It might reinforce the belief that the University of Maryland holds in testudo. The
outcome would be exciting and intriguing to every individual who is a part of the institution of UMD.


Our operationalized hypothesis is that, the person who rubbed Testudo’s nose experienced a positive occurrence, that they considered lucky, in the following week. We have considered the time frame of a week for the individuals. Stating the null and alternate hypothesis: 
Ho: People who rub Testudo’s nose do not experience any such positive occurrence within a week. 
H1: People who rub Testudo’s nose experience a positive event in their life within a week.

The statistical test conducted was the two-sample t-test as we have two samples of people - one set who rubbed
Testudo’s nose and experienced positive occurrences within a week and the other set who did not rub Testudo’s
nose and experienced positive occurrences within a week.
